In many ways, receipts can also serve as a powerful tool to capture moments and stories throughout the passage of time. I wanted to combine these two things in a shareable format, so that individuals can "collect" these glimpses and share them with friends and family.</p>',

        "<p>For this project, we were tasked to create an assistive device for a client with a disability. Our class focuses on small electronics and interaction, so we had to find a way to use those skills to create a device that would helpful for our client, Darnisha. Over the course of six weeks, we met with Darnisha, designed prototypes, tested prototypes, and finally created the final product.</p><br /><p>In our interviews, we found that Darnisha sometimes forgets where she puts her phone down throughout the day, and also has trouble reaching over to turn off the alarm in the morning. Our solution was a wheelchair attachment that lights up when the phone is not in the holder to remind Darnisha to keep her phone with her. The device also doubles as an alarm clock that turns off via motion sensing, so that Darnisha doesn't need to press any buttons or get up to grab anything.</p>",
